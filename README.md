# Project Overview

Welcome to our Pokemon-inspired project! We've delved into the world of Pokemon, celebrated as one of the most cherished TV shows of all time.

## Objective

Our goal is to build a predictive model estimating a Pokemon's probability of winning in combat. Using a dataset featuring historical battle outcomes, attributes, and skills, we're decoding the intricacies of Pokemon battles.

## Dataset

We've provided four CSV files, with a focus on `combat.csv` and `pokemon.csv`. These files drive our presentation. While we envisioned future enhancements using `team_combats` and `team_pokemon_id`, time constraints during exams prevented us from realizing this part. Apologies for any inconvenience!

Embark on this Pokemon journey with us as we unravel the magic of battles and predictive modeling!

# Installation and Onboarding

The installation of the library provides all the tools necessary for this model to run properly. Different functions, we decided to use classes for more clarity and interpretability, come into play in the model process at different stages.  

#### Step 1 - Installing the Library in your Local machine using Terminal:
 ```bash$ pip install -e .```
>This command will automatically install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt`, ensuring the library is set up correctly.

#### Step 2 - Importing the library and it's modules
(Insert at the beginning of your Python/jupyter file)
```
import library_final
from library_final.pokedex import DataLoader as ld
from library_final.pokedex import EDA as ea
from library_final.pokedex import DataPreprocessor as dp
from library_final.pokedex import ModelSelector as ml1
```
>Executing these modules in a systematic manner will equip you with the essential tools to establish a robust pipeline for your machine learning project

## Scalability and Robustness

Our approach to designing the process prioritizes generalization and readability. The avoidance of hardcoding and the maintenance of a clear structure play pivotal roles in ensuring scalability. Leveraging parent and child classes serves a dual purpose: it minimizes code repetition and facilitates the integration of processes, making it more adaptable to future modifications. A notable instance of this design philosophy is evident in the implementation of machine learning models.

In our system, a parent class acts as the overarching container for all models, efficiently calling methods specific to each model. Common processes such as fitting, training, predicting, and evaluating performance are shared across all models, contributing to a unified and streamlined structure. This design not only enhances code readability but also simplifies the incorporation of new machine learning models.

To introduce a new model, one only needs to create a new child class. This new class generates an instance of the model, handles the fitting process, and predicts the target variable. By referring to the methods established in the parent class, this approach eliminates the need to build an entirely new model from scratch, ensuring a scalable and robust foundation for future model expansions.

# Library Architecture  
In order to generate the library structure we need to run the following code: 
```
bash$ homebrew install tree
bash$ tree . >> tree.txt
```
>This command will generate the following `tree.txt`
